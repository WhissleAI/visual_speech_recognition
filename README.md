## Introduction
- This repo is made for updating GSoC 2024 project proposal with some helper codes that I for the project proposed. 
- Please download relevant data of audioset from the [link](https://research.google.com/audioset/download_strong.html)
- Download samples of People's Speech Dataset from here [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MLCommons/peoples_speech)
- Note that you can also use utils.ipynb as a scrip to download these datasets.
- Other tools that I have tried for the proposal include - [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), [shot_detection](https://github.com/makarandtapaswi/shotdetection/), [video_llava](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Video-LLaVA)
